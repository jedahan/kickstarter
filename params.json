Do not hesitate to [create a github issue](https://github.com/jedahan/kickstarter/issues) if anything is unclear.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n`ksr` is in the python package repositories, so `pip install ksr` should get you the latest stable release.\r\n\r\nIf you are in bash, you can activate shell completion with `eval \"$(_KSR_COMPLETE=source ksr)\"`\r\n\r\n## Testing and Development\r\n\r\nThe tests require [assert.sh](https://github.com/dansoton/assert.sh), which are included as a submodule, and can be installed with `git submodule update --init --recursive`\r\n\r\nRun the tests via `./tests.sh`. `ksr` has only been tested on python 3.5 on osx.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to contribute, thanks!
